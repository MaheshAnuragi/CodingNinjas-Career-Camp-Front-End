            Web &nbsp    &nbsp  <!-- nbsp means no break space between-->      .development is the work involved in developing a 
            website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from 
            developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. 
            A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, 
            Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, 
            and e-commerce development.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup 
            and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with 
            basic technical skills.
